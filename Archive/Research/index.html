In these structures, tubular joints serve as key components because they feature high stress concentrations. The fact that steel material is highly sensitive to high temperatures makes the tubular joints vulnerable under fire conditions. The relevant design guidelines (such as CIDECT and Eurocode 3) provide limited details on the performance of these joints at elevated temperatures. To understand the response of tubular structures throughout the entire fire process, a series of experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical derivations were conducted. Based on this project, a finite-element simulation platform was developed in ABAQUS to accurately capture the structural response of joints. Moreover, a series of empirical equations were proposed to predict the critical temperatures for joints with various geometric configurations.</p>

This project aims to propose an alternative design method: performance-based analytics-driven seismic design, which is applied to steel moment resisting frame (SMRF) buildings. In this project, a Python-based computational platform was developed to automate the seismic design, structural modeling, and seismic response simulation. Then a comprehensive database including more than 600 SMRF designs and their responses are constructed. Using the database, three machine learning-based data-driven models are developed to estimate the seismic drift demand in SMRFs and the efficacy of newly-developed and existing model is investigated. Finally, a set of surrogate models are created to estimate the probabilistic distribution of engineering demand parameters, which are further adopted to evaluate the earthquake-induced economic losses.</p>
