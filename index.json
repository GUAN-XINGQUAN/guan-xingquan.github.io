This framework meticulously incorporates computer vision and well-structured data processing techniques. To demonstrate its efficacy, the proposed framework is applied to a comprehensive dataset, which includes 1400 non-ductile reinforced concrete frame designs, their nonlinear structural models, associated seismic responses, and the building exterior images. A thorough review of the application result reveals that the proposed framework is able to efficiently and reliably estimate the seismic drift demands in non-ductile reinforced concrete frames subjected to earthquake scenarios.

The epicenter of the the earthquake was in the Cimandiri Fault Zone and the depth of the rupture was approximately 11 km. While most of the damage was limited to the town of Cianjur, the shaking caused by the earthquake was felt as far as the capital city of Jakarta. The highest peak ground acceleration value recorded by the event was approximately 0.15 g at a station located approximately 14 km from the epicenter. The earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings, lifelines, and loss of human lives. The death toll from the earthquake was 310, with approximately one-third of the fatalities being children. Widespread damage to residential buildings, schools, and government buildings was reported following the earthquake. Indonesia has well-established building codes that explicitly address the issue of seismic design. However, much of the observed damage appears to have been due to non-compliance between the constructed buildings and the regulating building standards. Most of the affected structures were 1- and 2-story buildings constructed using masonry infills, some of which are surrounded by concrete frames (intended as confined masonry). In addition to building damage, the earthquake caused the disruption of several lifeline facilities, including potable water supply, power outage, and ground transportation. This project encompasses the products of StEER's response to this event, the Preliminary Virtual Reconnaissance Report (PVRR).","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"StEER 2022 Mw 5.6 Indonesia Earthquake Preliminary Virtual Reconnaissance Report (PVRR)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xingquan Guan","Henry Burton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"b202115bb8afd9c8ba8e4a5a8da43a99","permalink":"https://guan-xingquan.github.io/publication/journal-article-14/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-14/","section":"publication","summary":"When machine learning (ML) is used to solve practical problems in structural engineering (SE), the associated data may not reflect the overall distribution of the population. With this in mind, a common practice in prior ML-SE studies is to optimize the model such that the testing error is minimized. However, this strategy can lead to a situation where the testing error is significantly greater than the error obtained during training, which is a clear sign of overfitting. Therefore, simply selecting a model with the highest testing performance does not necessarily guarantee generalizability. To address this challenge, this study aims to provide some practical guidelines that consider both the model complexity and generalizability. The proposed solution is fairly straightforward to implement. The generalized bias-variance decomposition is first introduced, followed by a discussion of different error variation patterns (bell-shaped, double-descent, and monotonically decreasing). A mathematical formulation that establishes a relationship between the model complexity and generalizability via an objective function is then presented to facilitate the model parameter selection. Subsequently, four numerical experiments are conducted to apply the formulation within the structural engineering domain. Finally, the proposed model selection approach is compared with existing methods to demonstrate its advantages and limitations.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning: Theoretical formulation and implications to structural engineering applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xingquan Guan"],"categories":["News"],"content":"Together with Prof. Henry Burton, Xingquan Guan has published a paper that discusses the bias-variance trade off and the associated implications to structural engineering applications.

However, due to the labor-intensive and computationally processes of performing iterative response history analyses (NRHAs) and subsequent damage, loss, and downtime assessments, it has not been widely adopted in engineering practice. To address this challenge, several simplified methodologies have been developed for estimating building seismic response demands (i.e. so-called engineering demand parameters). One common theme among these models is that they are all rooted in the fundamental principles of structural dynamics and beam theory. However, while some rely solely on these basic physics and engineering principles, others have attempted to integrate basic statistical regression using structural response data generated from NRHAs performed on parametric structural models. In this study, the authors lay out a spectrum of methodologies for estimating structural response demands to be utilized in PBSD. On one end of the spectrum is a simplified purely mechanistic method, which is often preferred by practicing engineers because it is typically highly generalizable and easy to interpret. However, this method often relies on many simplifications which can influence the accuracy of the response estimates. On the other end of the spectrum is a purely data-driven model which utilizes parametric datasets generated from NRHAs, which is often viewed as a black box. However, these models are less reliant on the convenient simplifications that are adopted in the simplified mechanistic models and thus might achieve higher accuracy. Between these two extremes, there are models that combine elements of basic physics and statistical learning. This paper starts by introducing the development of a comprehensive database, which includes seismic designs of 621 steel moment resisting frames (SMRFs), the corresponding nonlinear structural models, and associated seismic responses (i.e., peak story drifts, peak floor accelerations, and residual story drifts). Then four existing methodologies that fall within the spectrum of seismic response estimation approaches are introduced, critically examined to reveal their benefits and drawbacks, systematically evaluated to quantitatively illustrate the accuracy. Inspired by these existing methods, one hybrid (mechanistic + data-driven) and one purely data-driven models are rigorously developed via training, testing, and validating against the database. Finally, a comparative assessment among mechanistic, hybrid, and data-driven models is performed.","tags":[],"title":"A comparative assessment of mechanistic and data-driven models to estimate building responses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xingquan Guan","Henry Burton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632700800,"objectID":"da048c4751325508fd15dd70fb836f01","permalink":"https://guan-xingquan.github.io/publication/conference-paper-4/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper-4/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces the development of an end-to-end computational platform that could automate the process of conducting seismic design, constructing nonlinear structural models, and performing response simulation (static and dynamic) of steel moment resisting frames.

The nonlinear model generation module takes the design results as input, automates the construction of nonlinear structural models that capture the flexural strength and stiffness deterioration and performs the pushover and response time history analyses. Three illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of the developed platform. The significance of this platform is a drastic reduction in time and effort involved in conducting iterative structural designs and nonlinear analyses, both of which are necessary for performance-based seismic design.

These models required a series of unexplainable features to be pre-proportioned and predetermined via experiments. Therefore, the a priori knowledge and experience of concrete engineers in terms of concrete formulation and proportioning are unfortunately neglected and wasted in this prediction logic, which might lead to serious predictive errors in concrete design and construction. In this study, a deep-learning based “factors-to-strength” approach that considers multiple explainable features and therefore takes advantage of existing job-site proportioning information is presented for concrete strength prediction. A deep convolutional neural network is proposed and trained using a data set consisting of 380 groups of concrete mixes. The accuracy and reliability of the model are validated by comparing with three models – SVM, ANN, and AdaBoost – using a data set prepared experimentally. The results show that the proposed model achieves high coefficients of determination (0.973 for the training set and 0.967 for the test set), demonstrating its excellent accuracy and generalization ability. This new model also reveals the interplay between varying explainable features in determining the compressive strength of concrete, hence facilitating an interactive experience for engineers to maneuver familiar and understandable factors for concrete strength design.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Accurate prediction of concrete compressive strength based on explainable features using deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Gao","Zhaoxiang Liu","Xingquan Guan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623715200,"objectID":"973062c0edb30595e483099d8055dc49","permalink":"https://guan-xingquan.github.io/publication/journal-article-12/","publishdate":"2021-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-12/","section":"publication","summary":"The fire resistance behavior of T-stub joint components at elevated temperatures was experimentally and numerically investigated..","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Fire resistance behavior of T-stub joint components under transient heat transfer conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The gas/water transmission pipeline system underpins a critical service that is foundational to a community’s well-being.

A phenomenological model that captures lateral load response and collapse behavior of PT connections is developed and then verified using previous experiments. To study the seismic performance of SC-MRFs, a prototype building, which has SC-MRFs as its lateral force resisting system, is considered for the analytical modeling. A 2D OpenSees model for the SC-MRF is built by using the developed phenomenological model. A conventional welded MRF (WMRF) model, which has the same member sizes is also created. Finally, monotonic pushover analysis and incremental dynamic analysis are performed on both SC-MRF and WMRF models. The static analysis results indicate that the static strength of the SC-MRF is 40% lower than that of the WMRF. The fragility results show that the WMRF has higher collapse resistance, whereas the SC-MRF undergoes smaller residual drift.","tags":[],"title":"Seismic performance of a self-centering steel moment frame building","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Gao","Xingquan Guan","Hongping Zhu","Yibin Ye"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529452800,"objectID":"0e8a11c673e1e0bdddb16a57b2b56b53","permalink":"https://guan-xingquan.github.io/publication/journal-article-5/","publishdate":"2018-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-5/","section":"publication","summary":"The fire resistance behavior of completely overlapped tubular joints was studied through an experimental and numerical study.

Using the database, three machine learning-based data-driven models are developed to estimate the seismic drift demand in SMRFs and the efficacy of newly-developed and existing model is investigated.

The finite element (FE) method is an effective tool for the research. In this paper, the hysteretic behavior of tubular T-joints reinforced with doubler plates after fire exposure is studied. To establish a reference point, a doubler plate-reinforced tubular T-joint specimen after exposure to fire was tested to failure under the cyclic axial loading at the brace end. The failure mode of the specimen was the cracking along the weld toe at the intersection of the doubler plate and brace. The experimental hysteretic curve and skeleton curve were compared with the FE results and good agreement was obtained. Thus, the FE method was verified and could be used to study the post-fire hysteretic behavior. A comprehensive parametric study was then conducted by varying different geometric parameters. It was found that parameter ε had little influence on the post-fire hysteretic behavior. On the other hand, the joints with a large γ or small β or ξ had a low capacity for post-fire hysteretic behavior.","tags":[],"title":"Parametric study on hysteretic behavior of doubler plate-reinforced tubular T-joints after fire exposure","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Welded tubular structures have been widely used in large-span structures, such as stadiums, television towers, airport terminals, and offshore jacket platforms. In these structures, tubular joints serve as essential components to connect different branches. Steel material is susceptible to high temperatures, which makes the tubular joints vulnerable under fire conditions. The relevant design guidelines (such as CIDECT and Eurocode 3) provide limited details on the performance of these joints at elevated temperatures. To enhance the understanding of the tubular joints’ fire resistance behavior, this project involved a series of full-scale experimental tests and disclosed the joint’s failure mechanism, force-deformation development, and thermal response. Then a generic finite element framework was proposed to simulate the tubular joint’s response during the entire firing process, including pre-fire, heating, cooling, and post-fire stages. After validating the finite element simulation against the experimental data, many finite element models were constructed to quantify the influence of various joint parameters on fire resistance. Based on the data collected from the experimental tests and numerical simulations, a series of equations were proposed to predict the maximum temperature various joints could sustain without losing too much strength. Such equations fill the blank area of the associated design guidelines.\n","date":1377993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1377993600,"objectID":"bd25f7bc3ab82c1115b697404efe72a5","permalink":"https://guan-xingquan.github.io/project/fire-resistance-behavior-of-welded-tubular-structures/","publishdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fire-resistance-behavior-of-welded-tubular-structures/","section":"project","summary":"This project aims to establish a systematic understanding of the fire resistance behavior of steel tubular joints and provide a set of guidelines to inform design.","tags":["Physics-Based Simulation","Experimental Test"],"title":"Fire Resistance Behavior of Welded Tubular Structures (2013 - 2016)","type":"project"}]
